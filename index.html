<br><br> <h2> 3/3/2022/Thurs </h2>
<p> I can't believe that I could have survived like this. <br>
  I now understand the importance of my home, since all I've been doing is making things worse in every possible way.
  Still, it's a good thing that I forget well.
  <br> I guess I enjoy this life. At least for now.
  <br> If I make a list of the things I've done.
  <br>1. I got in late in the first class, and almost cried and glared at the professor as if I were a four year old kid.
  <br>2. Not full prepared (as in hair messy, teeth messy and all), I almost missed my class because of the wifi. That's not it. I actually ran a chat to everyone as a "I'm here!!" 3 times, and mailed my professor that the wifi works like shit. And then i got desperate enough to run outside to the rooftop , barefoot, some kind of construction going by behind me, and I looke like shit because my arms started to hurt a lot, holding my ipad. <strong> And then, </strong> I questioned my professor about Oh I got in late today ,(I pronounciated like shit) so is my attendance ok? and he said yes. but in a <strong> reluctant </strong> way, which I can't figure out why. Then I said "bye" to him as if .. anyway he replied <strong> again ,</strong> reluctantly.
<br> 3. Things got better when my Barbour clothes came. It's so cute. so cute that I look like a kid. stil, I like it.
So I decided to wear this for the day, to show off. That's why I came out, feeling good, taking a unoccupied ,unsunny branch, to grab a new latin book I rented yesterday. But I tore it. just a bit, but I did tore it. I called all friends except my family. and they didn't receive my calls. So I looked the price up, 28$ at amazon. I am a little bit relieved. I thought it would cost more than that. So I walk toward the library, ready to take out my 50 dollar cash.
And I go to one of the library lady, who looks so innocent. And I immediately tell her. "I'm so sorry I tore off this book"
i thought she'd make me pay. But she said she wants some debris. and I gave it to her. in the middle of the library, snatching up just one piece of paper. Than she said she could probably fix that. so I said I'm sorry again, and I left.  </p>

<br><br>But then I remebered.
<br> <strong> I DON'T HAVE TO TRY HARD TO LOOk GOOD ANYMORE </strong>

<h2> 3/4/2022/Fri

  Today must be the day before my period begins. or maybe a few days before.
  I feel dreary and tired and all...
